Multi-Disease Risk Assessment using machine learning approach
Efficiently gauging disease risk in modern healthcare settings remains a pressing challenge, often necessitating preliminary diagnostic tools to analyze provided health metrics due to practical constraints. Our main goal is to equip healthcare professionals with a tool that predicts disease likelihood and offers insights for informed medical consultations. Through rigorous testing, we aim to refine our models, enhancing accuracy and reliability in assessing disease risk.Through rigorous testing and evaluation, we aim to refine our models, enhancing their accuracy and reliability in assessing disease risk. By leveraging datasets from reputable sources such as the UCI Machine Learning Repository and Kaggle, our project aims to build predictive models based on individual health indicators. These inputs, ranging from glucose levels to BMI, are fed into our system, which employs various machine learning algorithms for accurate predictions. In the following sections, we'll provide insights into our dataset, including preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis findings, initial model construction, and preliminary results.
